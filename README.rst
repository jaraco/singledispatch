`PEP 443 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0443/>`_ proposed to expose
a mechanism in the ``functools`` standard library module in Python 3.4
that provides a simple form of generic programming known as
single-dispatch generic functions.

This library is a backport of this functionality and its evolution.

Refer to the `upstream documentation
<http://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch>`_
for API guidance. To use the backport, simply use
``from singledispatch import singledispatch, singledispatchmethod`` in place of
``from functools import singledispatch, singledispatchmethod``.


Maintenance
===========

This backport is maintained on Github by Jason R. Coombs, one of the
members of the core CPython team:

* `repository <https://github.com/jaraco/singledispatch>`_

* `issue tracker <https://github.com/jaraco/singledispatch/issues>`_
